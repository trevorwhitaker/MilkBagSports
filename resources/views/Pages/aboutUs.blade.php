<p>
What is a milkbag you say? Literally, it’s a bag filled with milk. But for us, its much more. It’s a way of life, and we embrace it fully. We’re simply a bunch of good ole Canadian boys giving the hottest takes this side of the Arctic circle. Unapologetically Canadian, we like hard-nosed hockey, fries smothered in gravy and cheese, and Shania Twain. We have extensive years of mediocre semi-competitive experience in several sports including puck, hoops, football and baseball. One of us even has a journalism degree (so all our articles are legit).
